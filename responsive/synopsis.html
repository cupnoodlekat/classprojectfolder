         <h1>Synopsis of the Seasons</h1>
        <p>Trying to break down the seaons of Game of Thrones is like swallowing a bag of rocks. It's painful. And what's the reward you might ask, well,  
            knowledge of the cool and epic lore of the GOT universe. Despite it's short comings, the show has a lot to offer in the entertainment aspect. 
            Even the slow burning episodes manage to keep you locked in wondering who to trust, who's fighting on who's side, and jesus christ how many sides
            are there? Don't fret, it's much easier to manage towards the end when just about all of them are dead. Spoiler alert. Regardless, if you happen to find 
           yourself wondering what happened each season and why, I'm about to tell you.  </p>
